=================

API Explorer is a live documentation client for HTTP APIs that provides a nice and highly customizable UI.


* **Extensible**: API Explorer provides an extensible system, based on plugins, that allow you to control several
   aspects of the UI, interactions with your API endpoints and the API Specification. 
* **API Specification loaders**: It is pre-bundled with Swagger (v1, v2) API specification loaded, but can be extended
  to handle other specifications.
* **Multiple APIs**: You can have multiple API handled in the same UI for convenience.
* **Developer friendly**: We provide a built-in development server to test your plugins and settings, 
  with features such as a proxy for bypass CORS restrictions
* **Clean UI and user friendly**: The UI is focused in the API operation, making it a first class citizen in the UI.
  Some user friendly aspects are also implemented, like: deep-link to api operations with pre-filled parameters; history for 
  API request responses; API deprecation indicator; custom headers.


## How To Use

Since API Explorer is distributed as a library it won't work out of the box without some configuration.
You can opt-in for the following minimum configuration or use an advanced configuration explained in the [advanced configuration section](#advanced-configuration).

These are the steps to get API Explorer working for some API that is described in Swagger v2.

- Download the `API.Explorer.*.zip` file from the [releases](https://github.com/sky-uk/api-explorer/releases) page for this project.
- Expand the file to get the `APIExplorer.umd.js` and `index.html` files
  - The `.js` file is the API Explorer library bundle
  - The `index.html` is a sample HTML index file you can/should use to bootstrap. It contains some CSS/JS external of API Explorer, the DOM hook node and some styles.
- Copy the files to a new folder or to the root of your Server/API
- Edit the `index.html` file to configure your API
  - Add a `<script ...>` tag as the last `<body>` element with the following:
  - **Option A)** if you are hosting `index.html` in the same server/api:
  
    ```js
    APIExplorer
      .addAPI('some-api', 'swagger2', '/path/to/the/api/spec', c => {
        c.addHeader('X-API-Key', 'Some Value')  // You may add custom headers
      })
      .start()
    ```
  - **Option B)** if you are hosting `index.html` in a distinct server/api:
  
    ```js
    APIExplorer
      .addAPI('some-api', 'swagger2', 'https://example.com/path/to/the/api/spec', c => {
        c.addHeader('X-API-Key', 'Some Value')  // You may add custom headers
      })
      .configCORS({ credentials: 'omit' })
      .start()
    ```


## Development

* To build this project you need to clone the repository and do the following. Note that you can change the port number using the `PORT` environment variable.

```
yarn install
yarn run dev
open http://localhost:3000
```

* This project uses [StandardJS](http://standardjs.com/) for linting the code.

```
yarn run lint
```

* To generate a production build you need to run the following commands:

```
yarn install
yarn run build
```

The output files are stored in the `dist` folder. You can grab the files and place then in your application server.



You can also use a local server to run this application using `npm start`



## Advanced Configuration

APIExplorer uses a fluent API to specify the internal behaviour.
The following example configures two distinct APIs in the same API Explorer instance, with a custom widget `HATEOAS`, 
and a plugin `samplePlugin`. It also configure how to handle credentials in a CORS scenario.
At the bottom, the `start` method triggers the API Specification download and subsequent UI render.

```javascript
APIExplorer
  .addAPI('petstore', 'swagger2', 'https://api.swaggerhub.com/apis/anil614sagar/petStore/1.0.0', c => {
    c.addHeader('X-Foo', 'Some Value')
    c.addHeader('X-Bar', 'Another Value')
    c.useProxy(true)
    c.setRequestTimeoutInMiliseconds(5000)
    c.listOperationsAtWelcome(true)
  })
  .addAPI('github', 'swagger2', 'https://api.apis.guru/v2/specs/github.com/v3/swagger.json', c => {
    c.useProxy(true)
  })
  .addWidgetTab('HATEOAS', APIExplorer.HATEOASWidget)
  .addPlugin(samplePlugin)
  .configCORS({ credentials: 'omit' })
  .start()
```
